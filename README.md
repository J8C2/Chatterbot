# AI Closed-Domain Chatbot for School District

## Project Description
This project involves developing a closed-domain AI chatbot tailored for a school district. The chatbot aims to improve communication and streamline access to district-provided information such as enrollment processes, lunch menus, bus schedules, and academic calendars. By leveraging modern AI technologies, the chatbot will deliver accurate and context-aware responses, reducing administrative workload and enhancing user experience for parents, students, and staff.
