In This Section Navigation MPS Logo & Brand Guidelines  WELCOME LETTER After 22 years with the same mark, any organization\u2019s logo can become modified without having dedicated brand guidelines. We recognized it as an opportunity to rebrand and publish new guidelines for us. It is such an honor to have listened to what our stakeholders believe and expect of us, and now present our new logo during this time in MPS\u2019s history. After conducting research across our district audiences and stakeholders, several descriptive words are either used or that come to mind when discussing MPS such as growth, strength, resilience, safety, and family. As one of the largest public school districts in Oklahoma, it is a point of pride to know that our district is engaged and feels like a part of our MPS family. Most importantly, you trust the work that we do. I\u2019m thrilled to present ourMPS Brand Guidelinesand invite you to help us secure and protect the visual image and consistency of our new district logo. Thank you for advocating for Moore Public Schools and being a part of our history and journey. New Logo Info & Brand Guidelines WHY A NEW LOGO The MPS logo of the \"growing student\u201d was implemented in 2001 and has served our district well. Over the past 22 years, MPS has grown and advanced in all aspects of technology and academic innovation for the benefit of our students, and so now is an appropriate time to update our organization\u2019s brand and logo. Our new logo is an updated and enhanced version of the 2001 mark for several important reasons. This new mark honors our long and rich history and encourages a look forward to the possibilities for all those who are a part of our present and our future. The new MPS logo is as distinct as our district and reflects the hopeful spirit and energy for learning and growing that represent our students and our employees. MPS is a diverse community of Pre-K through 12th-grade students. Our students, their families, and our employees are comprised of countless backgrounds and cultures, and we likewise provide just as many pathways for learning. The new MPS logo represents our whole family, past, present, and future. LOGO RESEARCH MPS Administration conducted a survey of its internal and external stakeholders in the winter of 2023. Survey recipients were of varied generations and cultures and are people involved with MPS in numerous ways. We asked employees at all levels of the organization and from every division to tell us what they think. We asked community and business partners for their opinions and input. We invited students, parents, and guardians to tell us how they feel about MPS. When analyzing the survey data, there were some clear points of reference. Our stakeholders appreciate and enjoy being a part of MPS in the specific capacity in which they are connected. Our stakeholders also hold a significant sense of pride in our history, and they value the academic progress our students have accomplished over the decades. When redesigning the new logo, our stakeholders\u2019 input was continually referenced; it is what matters to our students, to our employees, and to our community. OUR LOGO ANATOMY The new identifying mark of Moore Public Schools tells the story of our district. You can read the full details and story in ourMPS Brand Guidelines. Let\u2019s look at what inspires our logomark. An obvious representation of education is a book. Depending on your perspective, the new MPS mark has lines indicating the shape of a book, with a student behind the pages reading. This same shape affirms an aspect of safety when within our schools; an item our stakeholders continually said that we do well. These lines also signal the shape of an \u201cM\u201d as a reference to our district\u2019s name. Our stakeholders confirmed that one of our strengths lies in the abundant programs and resources that support each student\u2019s educational journey. From academics to mental health, MPS is committed to providing pillars of support that enrich each student\u2019s personal and scholastic experience while they are with us. These \u201cpillars\u201d represent every educator, support staff member, academic program, coach, resource, and system in place to assist MPS students as they strive to reach their highest potential. We concentrate on the foundational learning, growth, and development of each student as they strive to grow into responsible citizens and leaders. We know that what we nurture will flourish, so we are careful to sow seeds of care, respect, and guidance that sprout into a love of learning among our student body. These lines also represent the pathways into college and careers that our graduates take once they leave MPS. Shaping Today\u2019s Students Into Tomorrow\u2019s Leaders. This is our MPS Vision and it is exemplified in our new district logo. MPS BRAND GUIDELINES   Read the MPS Brand Guidelines and learn more about our storyHERE. Get In Touch QUICK LINKS  Stay Social"

Per state law, MPS students follow tornado safety guidelines at all schools and practice fire drills, intruder drills, and tornado drills throughout the year. Any time there is a risk of severe tornadic weather, we will follow our District Tornado Sheltering Plan as follows: If a severe weather watch or warning is issued while students are in school, parents/guardians have the option of picking up/checking out their student and receiving an excused absence.If someone other than the parent/guardian is checking out a student, ensure your child\u2019s school has the correct non-parent emergency contact information on file.

If the severe weather is unexpected and a bus is en route, drivers will seek safety at the nearest school. Additionally: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each school has a crisis intervention team and a written crisis plan that outlines procedures regarding safety concerns/intruders, severe weather/tornado, gas leaks, fire, etc. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Office of the Superintendent, the Safety and Security Office, and other district officials are in contact with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Norman when severe weather is anticipated.

The live feed allows for real-time questions and answers about storm fronts, and weather-related alerts and issues. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The MPS Administration utilizes the districtwide emergency radio system to immediately communicate with school principals and departments, individually and/or simultaneously. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Should a weather incident occur during school hours we will communicate with families using the email and mobile contact numbers listed for your student in Infinite Campus.

ELA OneNote for Teachers FINE ARTS: ELEMENTARY  Fine Arts: Secondary   Gifted/Talented The gifted education program in Moore includes elementary students identified through a variety of measurement methods, junior high pre-AP students, and high school pre-AP and AP students.Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction\u00a0within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive\u00a0field trips, and Summer Camps.) The purpose of the secondary gifted education program is to provide educational opportunities modified in pace, depth, and breadth in individual subject areas. Honors and Advanced Placement classes are offered in language, math, social studies, science, computers, and the arts. Most of the Honors\u00a0classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP)\u00a0classes.\u00a0 A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered.\u00a0Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test\u00a0is administered to all 2nd grade \u00a0students in the district.\u00a0This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the\u00a0 gifted program.\u00a0In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered.\u00a0Parents may\u00a0 request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes.\u00a0The placement\u00a0guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge. Gifted Education records:\u00a0All Gifted Education records are confidential and are kept in the Gifted Education Office. Parents of students who move out of district must submit a request for records to the Gifted Education Office, Moore Public Schools, 1500 S. E. 4th Street, Moore, OK 73160.

Transfers that have previously been approved by the school district will remain in effect for future school years unless the district provides notification to the parent or legal guardian that the transfer is not going to be continued for an upcoming school year due to capacity, disciplinary action, or attendance issues. The district will not require parents to resubmit a new application each school year and will advance the previous application of an enrolled student, amending only the grade placement of the student. A transfer may be requested at any time in the school year.State law does limit the ability of a student to transfer no more than two (2) times per school year to one or more school districts in which the student does not reside. Exceptions to this limit will exist for students in foster care. Students are legally entitled to re-enroll at any time in his or her school district of residence. A separate application must be filed for each student in the same family wishing to transfer so that the district can timely consider requests in the order applications are received. It is the policy of the board of education that any legally transferring student shall be accepted by the district under the following circumstances: 1. The district has the capacity to accept students at the grade level at the school site; 2. The transferring student has not been disciplined for: a. violation of a school regulation, b. possession of an intoxicating beverage, low-point beer, as defined by Section 163.2 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or missing or stolen property if the property is reasonably suspected to have been taken from a student, a school employee, or the school during school activities, or c. possession of a dangerous weapon or a controlled dangerous substance while on or within two thousand (2,000) feet of public-school property, or at a school event, as defined in the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. 3.

By the first day of January, April, July, and October, the board of education shall establish the number of transfer students the district has the capacity to accept in each grade level for each school site within the district. The number of transfer students for each grade level at each site that the district has the capacity to accept will be posted in a prominent place on the school district\u2019s website. The district shall report to the State Department of Education the number of transfer students for each grade level for each school site which the district has the capacity to accept. Capacity Determination The following calculations will be used to determine Program Capacity For grades PK through grade 1, student capacity is set at 16 students per classroom. For grades 2-6, student capacity is set at 20 students per classroom. For grades 7-12, capacity is set based on student enrollment in the regular education required core classes for each grade level. The student capacity is set at 24 students. Transfer of Certified Employee's Children A student shall be allowed to transfer to a district in which the parent or legal guardian of the student is employed as a certified teacher as per 70 O.S. \u00a7 8-113. Dependent Children of Active Duty Military Students who are the dependent children of a member of the active uniformed military services of the United States on full-time active-duty status and students who are the dependent children of the military reserve on active duty orders shall be eligible for admission to the school district regardless of capacity of the district.

If accepted, a student transfer is granted for the existing school year and may continue to attend in future years. At the end of the school year, the district may deny continued transfer of the student due to capacity or for disciplinary reasons or a history of absences. Transfer Acceptance Transfers that have previously been approved by the school district will remain in effect for future school years unless the district provides notification to the parent or legal guardian that the transfer is not going to be continued for an upcoming school year due to capacity, disciplinary action or attendance issues. The district will not require parents to resubmit a new application each school year and will advance the previous application of an enrolled student, amending only the grade placement of the student.

In This Section Navigation MPS Bond Election Information  If you are having trouble viewing the document, you maydownload the document. Frequently Asked Questions How was the need for the bond election determined? The Patrons Advisory Committee (PAC) - a group of residents, business leaders, parents/guardians, members of the Board of Education, and school staff - has been evaluating where our district is now and what our district\u2019s future needs will be. As one of the largest districts in the state that continues to experience community growth, we are diligent in maintaining the balance of class size and availability of classrooms. With ever-changing technology advancements and increase of learning options, we must ensure our students have adequate tools and resources for their education. We want our students to have top of the line facilities where they may truly excel. MPS provides a comprehensive STEM/STEAM program for K-12 students. College & Career Readiness Centers would help create pathways for our students from high school to either college or their future careers. The components of this bond issue will propel student success regardless of our district\u2019s and community\u2019s population growth and learning options.  When is the bond election, and where do I vote? The bond election date is Tuesday, May 11, 2021. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Voting will be in precincts where all other elections are held. All registered voters living in the Moore Public Schools district attendance boundaries are eligible to vote.  How much is the bond issue, and will approval raise my taxes? This is a multi-phased bond with reoccurring funds to be issued throughout an eight-year period. A tax increase based on historical average is not expected over the life of the bond. This has been determined based on anticipated community growth of 3%, with this past year\u2019s community growth of almost 7%. Two propositions will be on the ballot. Proposition 1: Construction, Renovation, Repair, Replacement Projects with a projected cost of $338,700,000. Proposition 2: Transportation with a projected cost of $8,000,000.  How will this bond election benefit my child? Every student, in every grade level, and in every school will benefit from this bond. Our schools have different needs due to when they were originally constructed, student population, etc. If the bond passes, the following needs will be met: additional classroom space, heat and air conditioning in facilities and gyms, enclosed practice facilities, roofs, media center(s), safety and security entrances, enclosed campuses, etc. ALL SCHOOLS will receive adequate, much-needed technology and safety/security upgrades to support the educational needs of students well into the future.  How do we know the bond funds are spent the way they are supposed to be? Our district has a proven and trusted history of completing bond projects as promised. Of the bond projects since 1999, one hundred percent were completed on time and within budget. We are responsible stewards of our taxpayers\u2019 money and will continue this commitment to our community.  What percentage of voters must support a bond election? The State of Oklahoma requires a super majority of votes cast. Therefore, at least 60% of those votes must be in favor of the bond election for approval.  Can bond money be used for staff salaries? No. The law only allows bond money to be used for capital improvements and certain instructional materials. This money cannot be spent on salaries, benefits, supplies, or any other general fund expenses.  Can I still vote if I am going to be out of town on election day, May 11, 2021? Yes. Applications for absentee ballots are available at the Cleveland County and Oklahoma County Election Board offices and available online at: www.ok.gov/elections. The application to receive an absentee ballot must arrive at your county election board office before 5 p.m. on May 5. The completed ballots must be returned to your county election board office by mail no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election. (Postmark will not suffice; the ballots themselves must be at the county election board office by 7 p.m. on election day). Voters may cast an absentee ballot in person at their county\u2019s election board office by 5 p.m. on or before Monday, May 10.  What happens if the bond election does not pass? Bond money is critical for construction projects necessary to accommodate student growth and ever-evolving learning needs. It is also necessary to provide maintenance and major repairs to schools and facilities. Without these bond funds, monies from other annual district funding sources would be decreased to accomplish the projects included in the proposed bond issue. Get In Touch QUICK LINKS Stay Social"

In This Section Navigation Early Childhood  Overview: The Moore Public Schools Early Childhood program is designed to meet the special needs of young learners, and teaching is based on the knowledge of how young children develop and learn. Many learning opportunities are provided in a child-centered environment equipped with a wealth of concrete, open-ended instructional materials. Daily opportunities are provided for the children to choose from a wide range of activities and experiences. The day is thoroughly and carefully planned to achieve long-range goals for all children. Flexibility is deliberately built in to allow for special needs, circumstances and interests. However, planning and organization promotes continuity, routine and daily repetition necessary for the young child. Children are actively engaged in their learning. They observe, they interact with materials and with people, and they ask questions as they explore new concepts and expand their understandings.  The curriculum provides richness and a wide variety of learning experiences, materials, and instructional strategies to accommodate a broad range of children\u2019s individual differences in prior experiences, maturation rates, styles of learning needs and interests. \u00a0Children\u2019s sense of competence and enjoyment of learning is strengthened by allowing opportunities for choice and by providing experiences in which children feel successful.  The primary focuses for teaching in the early years are . . . to instill a love for learning; to emphasize creativity, literacy, and mathematical reasoning; and to provide a context for healthy interactions among the students and the adults.  We believe. . . \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that all children are individuals who learn in their own way and at their own pace \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that play is the most important process through which young children learn \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that children learn best through educational experiences that are developmentally appropriate \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that parents are a vital part of the learning process \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that a collaborative approach should be taken to education where can children learn from each other \u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 that a qualified, dedicated staff is critical to the development of a quality early education program  Pam Plumley Early Childhood Coordinator Phone:\u00a0405-735-4264 Email  Get In Touch QUICK LINKS  Stay Social"

Through a study of the language arts, students learn to use and interpret spoken, written, electronic, and visual texts and messages. By studying the processes \u2013 how people communicate, and the content \u2013 what they communicate, students learn the knowledge, skills, and strategies that enable them to solve problems and to think and respond critically across all curriculum areas and to real-life situations.

In This Section Navigation English Learners Content Title III - English Learners We are a\u00a0program for\u00a0bilingual students who qualify for EL\u00a0services.\u00a0Our teachers\u00a0ensure that these students master English and meet the same rigorous standards for academic achievement as all children are expected to meet.\u00a0All district sites receive ELL services. Funding for this grant pays for materials, supplies, testing and required professional development opportunities. We currently serve approximately 1,800\u00a0students. Title III/ English Language Learners Program Moore Public Schools offers Language Acquisition\u00a0services to all English Learners in grades Kindergarten through twelfth grade. The mission statement of the Title III EL\u00a0Program is: To provide high quality, research-based English language instruction in order to engage ELL students in English language development and grade-level academic standards. Identification and Assessment of English Language Learners All students complete a Home Language Survey upon enrollment. If a language other than English is spoken in the home the student is assessed with the ACCESS for ELL language proficiency test to determine the student's level of language proficiency per the Title III requirements of No Child Left Behind 2001. Students are identified as English Language Learners and eligible for ELL services if the overall score is below 5.0. Reassessment and Exiting of English Language Learners English Language Learners are reassessed each spring with the ACCESS for ELLs test per Title III of NCLB. When a student scores an overall score of 4.8 or higher the student is reclassified as Proficient. Proficient students are conditionally exited from ELL services and placed on monitor status for two full academic years immediately following the proficient score. Once the two year monitoring phase has been completed successfully the student is formally exited from all ELL services. Parent Notification Parents will be notified of their student's ACCESS for ELLs test score by the district. Per Title III of NCLB, parents have the right to decline for their student to participate in ELL services by completing a Waiver Form, available upon written request to the ELL Center. Although parents can decline for their students to participate in ELL services, students identified as ELLs cannot be waived from participating in the annual ACCESS for ELLs test. Parental Rights and Responsibilities Research shows that children who are literate in their first language perform much better in school than children who are not literate in their first language. Please continue to interact with your children in your first language and to encourage them to become bilingual. Get In Touch QUICK LINKS Stay Social"

However, there is an additional option, Honors Algebra I, for students who excel in math, have a desire for advanced studies, are self-motivated, and typically score at advanced levels on state tests, pending fulfillment of requirements. 6th grade students who are interested in taking Algebra I in 7th grade can take the Summer Algebra I Prep Course and MPS Algebra I Readiness Test to see if they have an adequate understanding of concepts that will enable them to successfully complete the course. (Rising 8th grade students who did not take Pre-Algebra can also select this route). More information and the registration link can be found below. Please read all the information provided, the program and\u00a0requirements are updated annually. Please read all information below MPS Math Paths On-level vs Honors vs Accelerated Path- which path is right for your student? Grades and Credits 1. Students taking Algebra I in 7th grade may be bused to the high school for Geometry. This will result in a release time that is about one-hour later, limiting student participation in many after-school activities at the junior high. 2. Grades earned from Honors Algebra I and/or Honors Geometry in Junior High will forever be on the student\u2019s high school transcript and will be calculated into the high school graduating GPA (grade point average). This affects class ranking as well as the overall GPA. Class of 2025-2028: Honors Algebra I and Honors Geometry\u00a0taken in junior high willnotcount toward the 3 math credits that are required to be earned in high school. (State Law 70 O.S. \u00a7 11-103.6 (OSCN 2020)). The grades earned cannot be removed from the student's transcript. Beginning with the Class of 2029:Only Honors Algebra I and Honors Geometry taken in 8th grade will count toward the 4 math credits that are required to be earned in high school (State Law 70 O.S. \u00a7 11-103.6 (OSCN 2024)). The grades earned cannot be removed from the student's transcript. 3. Students taking Algebra I in 7th grade are expected to take AP Calculus in 11th grade and other AP/College level math courses their senior year. Each math course completed must be a higher-level course than the preceding year. 4.\u00a0Any student in Honors Algebra I, in either 7th or 8th, who qualified through the\u00a0prep course and readiness exam, with a D or F at the end of the first semester\u00a0will automatically be placed into Pre-Algebra second semester. The semester grade will stand and cannot be changed. (Fall break is the final deadline to change course enrollment without affecting transcript and GPA.) 5. Students in other Honors math classes, Pre-Algebra (7th), and Algebra 1 (8th), who have earned a D or F at the end of the first semester will be encouraged to move back into a lower level\u00a0math course for 2nd semester. 6.\u00a0Students who earn a C or lower both semesters in Honors Pre-Algebra, Honors Algebra I, or Honors Geometry\u00a0will be encouraged to repeat the course the next school year or take the non-honors course if available.\u00a0 The reasoning for this is because the student is not showing adequate conceptual understanding to progress and be successful as the rigor increases in subsequent math courses. Summer Course for Honors Algebra I Students in 6th grade, enrolling in 7th grade for 2025-2026, can register to take the MPS Honors Algebra I Summer Prep Course and Readiness Exam. Registration will be open in May; a reminder will be sent via ParentSquare. Students in 7th grade math this year (24-25) who completed Math 7 and feel they are ready to take Algebra can also register for the Algebra I Summer Prep Course and Readiness Exam. \u00a0All students must fulfill the requirements for successful completion of the summer prep course and 90% or better on the readiness test. Students who successfully passed 7th grade Honors Pre-Algebra will automatically be enrolled in Honors Algebra I in 8th grade. Testing and the Algebra I Prep Course component are not required; however, any student who completed Pre-Algebra in 7th grade can enroll in the summer course if they wish to do so. Students registered in the Algebra I Summer Prep Course will be contacted by Mary Brese via email, after registration has closed in late May. Mary Brese is the Algebra I Readiness instructor for the summer program. Parent meeting (virtual): May 23, 2025 Course start date: May 24, 2025 Course completion date: 11:59pm on July 20, 2025 Assessment dates (in-person): July 21 - July 25  Additional Information Students can switch to non-honors math classes at any time, still following the math course progression but taking them off the Honors pathway. Students are likely to be bussed to the high school for Geometry in the 8thgrade. MPS does not offer online \u201chonors\u201d options. Students will not have the option of taking Honors Pre-Algebra, Honors Algebra 1, or Honors Geometry online. REGISTRATION WILL BEGIN AFTER TESTING, USUALLY EARLY MAY. A MESSAGE WILL BE SENT VIA PARENTSQUARE AND WILL BE ON THIS WEBSITE. REGISTRATION Please read the information provided before registering. REGISTRATION LINK Get In Touch QUICK LINKS  Stay Social"

    "text": "Job Opportunities Visit our Employment page for information and steps to start your career path with MPS! In This Section Navigation Planetarium  FAQ about the planetarium  WhAt is it exactly? It is an inflatable dome that students/teachers can enter and can display different learning materials on the inside of the dome.  What does it look like?  How much room does it take? It will require a 30' x 30' floor space and a 15' ceiling clearance. For most elementary schools, the gym is the only place that will house it.  How many can fit inside at a time? It can comfortably seat 25 adults. If possible, limit to 35 students and 3 adults at a time.  How long can we check it out? You can check it out for a week at a time. I will bring it out on a Friday and pick it up from you the following Friday.  Who runs the planetarium while it is at my school? Since it is housed in the gym, most schools have a PE teacher involved in the presentations along with one other teacher from the building. Who runs the planetarium is completely at the discretion of the school leaders. If you would like some suggestions, please contact Jenn Lowery.  So does that teacher need to stay with the planetarium all day? One teacher that is trained will need to stay with it while students are using it. The other teacher involved can rotate and can even be the homeroom teacher of the students using it. It is recommended that the classroom teacher experience the planetarium with their students to continue the conversation and learning once they are back in class.  Can we put it up and take it down multiple times a day? You can deflate it when it's not in use, but leaving it in place on the floor will be necessary until you are ready to pack it up for pick up. Moving it repeatedly causes a lot of wear and tear.  Do all students use it? That is entirely up to the school. Some schools use it with grades 3 - 6 to give each class a longer period of time to use it. Some schools make it part of the specials rotation so that all students experience it.  We have children with limited mobility issues. Can they use it? Absolutely! Typically you enter from narrow door, but there is a way to enter on the side if needed.  What do they see when they are in it? There are several options to show to students: How long does it take for each class? That completely depends on your schedule. If you choose to do it during specials - 2 of the topics could be shown. If you plan for a longer time period per class, you can possibly do three; however, consider the following: Is this a follow-up to a. previous lesson taught in the classroom; Is this an intro to a lesson? Is the part of the meat of the lesson? How you plan your time may need to be adjusted accordingly.  Do we have to keep it a whole week? No. If you want me to pick it up earlier, I will be more than happy to do that.  What kind of training does it require? It takes about an hour to learn how to put it up and take it down. Training will be offered once a quarter, and you will need to attend the training the quarter PRIOR to your reservation. At least two teachers need to be trained. A few weeks prior to your reservation, I can schedule some time with your teachers to go over available teaching tools and curriculum available. We typically schedule that during a plan time, before school, or after school - whatever best meets the needs of your staff.  Anything new I should know about since the 22-23 school year? We are currently working on a grade-level specific curriculum as well as a traveling library to accompany the planetarium.  How do I reserve this for my school?

In This Section Navigation Seal of Biliteracy Are You a\u00a0 9-12 Grader Who Can Speak Another Language in Addition to English?Reach out to your school counselor, world languages teacher, or ELL teacher about the Moore Public Schools Seal of Biliteracy Award Biliteracy refers to a person\u2019s ability to read, write and effectively collaborate with others in more than one language. However, in the fullest sense of the term, biliteracy extends beyond the acquisition of two separate languages and refers to the ability to use the knowledge of one language to support the other. WHAT IS THE SEAL OF BILITERACY? The Oklahoma Seal of Biliteracy is an award given by the Oklahoma State Department of Education in recognition of students who have studied and attained proficiency in English as well as an additional language upon high school graduation. It represents the state\u2019s commitment to value the whole student and foster pride in the cultural and linguistic heritage of our students. The Oklahoma Seal of Biliteracy encourages students to study languages, certifies attainment of biliteracy skills, recognizes the value of language diversity, and prepares students with 21st-century\u00a0skills that will benefit them in the labor market and the global society. Watch this quick video to learn more:Seal of Biliteracy Video Visit theOklahoma State Department of Education Seal of Biliteracy pagefor more information. HOW IS THE SEAL OF BILITERACY VALUABLE? The Seal of Biliteracy can be used as a credential to help differentiate students when they apply for jobs, college, or the military. The Oklahoma version of the credential recognizes students who have achieved this crucial 21st-century career and workplace skill distinction, promotes the learning of languages, and celebrates the linguistic and cultural diversity that strengthens our state. Biliterate students are less likely to drop out of high school, are more likely to go to college, have fewer behavior problems at school and obtain higher-paying jobs than their peers (G\u00e1ndara and Escamilla, 2017).

In This Section Navigation Title I Academic Resource Team - Title I Coordinator:Heather Wakefield Answers to Frequently Asked Questions What is Title I? Title I is a federally funded program which allows students, who are experiencing academic difficulty, to receive extra help and individual attention during the school day with no cost to the parents.\u00a0The federal funding is based on the free and reduced lunch program within the school.\u00a0\u00a0However, students are not required to be on free or reduced lunch to be eligible for Title I services. Targeted Title I In a targeted Title I program, all students within the school are given multiple assessments to identify student eligibility for Title I services. These test results determine which students need help and rank them in order of need.\u00a0\u00a0The students who need the most help are put on the list first. School-Wide Title I Sometimes schools qualify for school-wide Title I programs where the funds and resources can benefit all students attending that school. Often, in these schools, the Title I teachers go into the regular classroom or work with flexible groups of students as the need arises. How does Title I work with the regular school program? Title I teachers work very closely with the regular classroom teachers.\u00a0\u00a0Conferences between these teachers are held to ensure that the classroom teaching is being assisted and complimented.\u00a0\u00a0Student needs are discussed in order to meet the academic goals for each child. How are teaching priorities set within the Title I Program? Each building has a site-based planning committee.\u00a0\u00a0This committee is made up of parents, teachers, counselors, administrators, and Title I staff members.\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing test scores for the building, this committee decides which academic area is in the most need of improvement (Reading, Language, or Mathematics).\u00a0\u00a0The site based committee at each school has determined the area of reading to be our area of greatest need at this time. What are the Qualifications of the Title I Staff? Each Title I teacher has a Bachelor\u2019s\u00a0Degree in Education.\u00a0 Many Title I teachers are also Reading Specialists; holding a\u00a0Master\u2019s Degree in Reading. Is there anything I can do at home to help my child become a better reader? Yes!\u00a0\u00a0Surround your child with books and opportunities to read!\u00a0\u00a0Require your child to read for at least 15 minutes before going to bed each night. Discuss books that you are reading and ask your child to tell\u00a0you about books he or she is reading.\u00a0\u00a0Take family trips to book stores and libraries.\u00a0\u00a0Reading is fun and the love of reading is contagious! What are the opportunities for parent involvement in the Title I Program? There are many opportunities for parents\u00a0to become involved in their child\u2019s education through our Title I Program.\u00a0\u00a0There are activities throughout the year at your school and at district meetings.\u00a0\u00a0A few opportunities include: ~ Parent Receptions ~ Guest Speakers & Authors ~ Luncheons ~ Make & Take Workshops for Parents ~ Classroom Visits ~ Site-Based Planning Meetings * And Many More!!!\u00a0\u00a0Ask your child\u2019s Title I teacher or principal for more information on these activities!

(ESSA, Section 1116(a)(2)) The school district will work with its Title I schools to ensure that the parental involvement policies meet the requirements of the ESEA and include a school-parent compact. Each school will incorporate the district-wide parental involvement policy into its individual school plan. The school district and its Title I schools will provide full opportunities for the participation of all parents and provide information and school reports in an understandable and uniform format and alternative formats upon request. The school district will submit any and all parent comments with the plan when the school district submits the plan to the State Department of Education. The school district will involve parents of children served in Title I Part A schools in decisions about how the Title I parent involvement funds are spent. The school district will be governed by the following definition of parental involvement: Parental involvement means the participation of parents in meaningful, ongoing communication involving student learning and other school activities.

All Title I parents, administrators and teachers will have an opportunity to give input regarding school and parent programs through an annual needs assessment/program evaluation survey.\u00a0 The survey will reflect the varying needs at each school site and will become a priority consideration for Title I district and school plan revisions. Professional development activities will be provided and monthly staff meetings conducted.\u00a0 Title I will work with other disciplines to develop parental involvement activities across the curriculum. Each Title I school site will provide the results of an annual parent involvement survey to the district.\u00a0 The results of this survey may require that information be provided to parents in their native language. The Moore Public School District will develop and support a partnership among the school site involved, parents and the community to improve student academic achievement, through the following activities specifically described below: To support this partnership, activities such as workshops and conferences may include: Part III\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTION This district wide Parental Involvement Policy has been developed jointly with, and agreed on with, parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs, as evidenced by Melissa Tarman. This policy was adopted by Moore Public School District on May 08, 2024\u00a0and will be in effect for the 2024-2025 school year.

We also have several junior high and high school students who utilize our food pantries to help with hunger needs.Both programs are collaborative efforts between MPS and the Oklahoma Regional Food Bank (ORFB) to fight hunger within our community. Many of our students and staff volunteer at the ORFB, separating and boxing food. Understandably, not everyone can volunteer time.

TheBus Stop Locatorlink below will give you information regarding the\u00a0current school year. Since we have added an elementary and another junior high to our district, the routing information for a number of our\u00a0schools will change. This means that the stop locations, times and bus numbers\u00a0may not be the same as previous years. It will also\u00a0show\u00a0what school\u00a0 your child attends. TheRider Ruleslink is a set of guidelines put together by our safety and training department to give parents a great source of helpful information in hopes that they will practice using these guidelines with their children to increase the student's awareness of their own safety as well as the safety of others. This set of guidelines does not take away from or replace the rules for entering, riding, and exiting the bus found in the parent section of this site. It was created to support the existing guidelines as well as support the schools disciplinary guidelines by providing a quick reference for parents to work alongside their student's school and the Transportation Department.

In This Section Navigation Safety Tips for Entering Exiting and Riding the Bus Tips for Getting On & Off the Bus 1.Wait for the bus driver's signal to cross. Concerned parents who wait at bus stops with children are a tremendous asset. 2.Warn children that, if they drop something they should never pick it up. Instead, tell the bus driver and follow his instructions. If they bend down to pick up an object, they might not be seen by the driver. Loading and unloading is the most dangerous time. 3.Never cross behind the bus or where the driver can't see you. 4.The driver is not allowed to let a child board or get off the bus atanother stop with out permission from the Director of Transportation. Follow your school's procedures if you have an emergency and would like your child to get on or off at a stop other than the one assigned. 5.Wait on the side where the child will be dropped off, not acrossthe street. Children can be so excited at seeing you after schoolthat they dash across the street and forget the safety rules. 6.Never chase the school bus. Should a child miss the bus, instruct them to return home (in mornings) or return to campus office ( in afternoon) to make other transportation arrangements. Riding the Bus 1. Students should take their seats quickly. 2.Be courteous to the driver and follow his/ her instructions. 3. They may talk quietly,\u00a0but not distract the driver. 4.Students are rarely injured in bus accidents if they remain correctly seated. They should stay correctly seated, backpacks in their laps for the entire ride, and keep the aisles clear. Get In Touch QUICK LINKS Stay Social"

In This Section Navigation Career & Academic Plan  Career and Academic Plan:Frequently Asked Questions What is a Career and Academic Plan? Moore Public Schools works to connect students and families with the processes and opportunities to engage in the Oklahoma State Department of Education's Individual Career and Academic Plan (ICAP), which is required to be completed by each student prior to graduation. The Career and Academic Plan is a collaboratively developed, student-driven process where students cultivate their own informed decisions for success after high school. The Plans are based on each student\u2019s personal interests, skills, and future goals related to continued education and career, and they will work on developing their plan a little each year. The Career and Academic Plan is a multi-year process to assist and guide high school students as they explore careers, along with researching academic and post-secondary opportunities. While Career development and exposure begin as early as PreK, in 9th grade, students, their families, and their teachers work together to develop Individualized Career and Academic Plans. The process to create each Plan is designed to equip students over their time in high school with the awareness, knowledge, and skills to create their own meaningful exploration of college and career opportunities available after graduation. The Career and Academic Plan is an evolving document that \u2013 over the years \u2013 should reflect a student\u2019s changing aptitudes, interests, and growth. Career and Academic Plan Overview  What is the Career and Academic Plan Process? The Career and Academic Plan process includes: What are the minimum components of a student\u2019s Career and Academic Plan? Per HB 2155, to earn a diploma, students are required to complete components of Individual Career & Academic Planning each year starting in the 9th grade to include, but not be limited to: High School Career and Academic Plan Timeline Department Who Delivers Topic Social Studies Career Specialists and 10th-12thgrade teachers (not OK History) Assessments Science 9th-12thgrade teachers Goal Planning English 9th-12thgrade teachers Resumes & Work-Based Learning Math 9th-12thgrade teachers Education Planning Site/District Sponsored Workbased Learning Activities: How will my student be guided through the phases of the Career and Academic Plan? The Career and Academic Plan teams are made up of teachers, counselors, and administrators who will take advantage of what they do best: asking questions and directing students to resources. The working relationships that teachers develop with students will support efforts to connect students\u2019 strengths and interests to their post-secondary plans. Teachers will also take advantage of externships and opportunities to learn more about how their subject area is used in different occupations. How is a student\u2019s Career and Academic Plan progress monitored? Why a Career and Academic Plan? The goal of a Career and Academic Plan is to enable high school students to become college and career ready and it is also an Oklahoma requirement for all students to graduate. Students who are considered college and career ready understand the relevance of specific academic courses and out-of-school learning opportunities. As a result of moving through this process, students should select a more rigorous academic course schedule, increase their efforts to academically perform well, seek work-based learning opportunities and internships, and establish their intentions to pursue career training or a degree program while in high school and/or after graduation. Research suggests that the benefits of the Plan process increase student motivation, engagement, school connection, and awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses. Students utilizing a Career and Academic Plan also improve their understanding of post-secondary options, they better connect their goals to educational coursework and career-goal activities and engage in long-term planning for life after high-school graduation. With the elimination of seven state assessments and tests, Oklahoma was able to create the Career and Academic Plan in order to measure college and career readiness. For details related to HB 3218, visithttps://sde.ok.gov/hb3218. How is the Career and Academic Plan different from traditional product-based planning for students? The Career and Academic Plan is both a process and a product that helps students engage in academic and career development activities and produce an e-portfolio created and maintained for the student\u2019s academic, career, and personal advancement. These student-owned planning and monitoring tools help them create personalized programs of study that are aligned with high school graduation requirements, personal interests, and individually defined career goals. This also includes students with disabilities who have Individualized Education Programs (IEP/Post-secondary Transition Plans (PTP), as well as students with Section 504 Accommodation Plans, English Learners, students who are Gifted and/or Talented, students who are homeless, and students considered neglected and delinquent.
