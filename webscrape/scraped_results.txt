                    "When spring weather approaches, Moore Public Schools uses its safety procedures and weather plans. Thanks to our MPS Patrons and community who supported the 2015 bond issue, all students have access to a storm shelter. Per state law, MPS students follow tornado safety guidelines at all schools and practice fire drills, intruder drills, and tornado drills throughout the year. Any time there is a risk of severe tornadic weather, we will follow our District Tornado Sheltering Plan as follows: If a severe weather watch or warning is issued while students are in school, parents/guardians have the option of picking up/checking out their student and receiving an excused absence. If someone other than the parent/guardian is checking out a student, ensure your child’s school has the correct non-parent emergency contact information on file. Buses will be held at schools or the nearest safe location when immediate severe weather is expected. If the severe weather is unexpected and a bus is en route, drivers will seek safety at the nearest school. Additionally: · Each school has a crisis intervention team and a written crisis plan that outlines procedures regarding safety concerns/intruders, severe weather/tornado, gas leaks, fire, etc. · The Office of the Superintendent, the Safety and Security Office, and other district officials are in contact with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Norman when severe weather is anticipated. This occurs through a live feed between the NWS and the MPS Administration. The live feed allows for real-time questions and answers about storm fronts, and weather-related alerts and issues. · The MPS Administration utilizes the districtwide emergency radio system to immediately communicate with school principals and departments, individually and/or simultaneously. · Should a weather incident occur during school hours we will communicate with families using the email and mobile contact numbers listed for your student in Infinite Campus. Moore Public Schools uses the following outlets to send information to families: ParentSquare (PSQ) Primary source for messaging Email, phone and text messages (families & staff) MPS website : mooreschools.com Local news media : KFOR-4 KOCO-5 KWTV-9 KOKH-25 Social media (Only when necessary.

Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive field trips, and Summer Camps.)

Most of the Honors classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP) classes. A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered. Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered to all 2nd grade students in the district. This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered. Parents may request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes. The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge.

Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive field trips, and Summer Camps.) The purpose of the secondary gifted education program is to provide educational opportunities modified in pace, depth, and breadth in individual subject areas. Honors and Advanced Placement classes are offered in language, math, social studies, science, computers, and the arts. Most of the Honors classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP) classes. A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered. Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered to all 2nd grade students in the district. This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered. Parents may request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes. The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge. Gifted Education records: All Gifted Education records are confidential and are kept in the Gifted Education Office. Parents of students who move out of district must submit a request for records to the Gifted Education Office, Moore Public Schools, 1500 S. E. 4th Street, Moore, OK 73160.

The proficiency test dates for next year are: 2024-2025 Test date May 29, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year – applications due April 29, 2025 Test date August 25, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year– applications due July 25, 2025 All tests will be administered at the Administrative Service Center.

Applications may be obtained from the student's school counselor or printed here , and must be signed by both the principal and counselor, as well as the parent or guardian if the student is a minor. A copy of the student's transcript must be included with the application. If proficiency is shown, appropriate notation will be made for elementary, middle level or high school level students satisfactorily completing a 9-12 high school curriculum area. This unit will count toward meeting the requirements for the high school diploma. To download the Oklahoma State Regulations concerning Proficiency Based Promotion, click here: PBP Regulations .

                    "AP is a rigorous academic program built on the commitment, passion, and hard work of students and educators from both secondary schools and higher education. Since 1955, the AP Program has enabled millions of students to take college-level courses and exams, and to earn college credit or placement while still in high school. A 2008 study found that AP students had better four-year graduation rates than those who did not take AP. For example, graduation rates for AP English Literature students were 62 percent higher than graduation rates for those who took other English courses in high school. Taking AP also increases eligibility for scholarships and makes candidates more attractive to colleges.

                    "The gifted education program in Moore includes elementary students identified through a variety of measurement methods, junior high pre-AP students, and high school pre-AP and AP students. Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive field trips, and Summer Camps.) The purpose of the secondary gifted education program is to provide educational opportunities modified in pace, depth, and breadth in individual subject areas. Honors and Advanced Placement classes are offered in language, math, social studies, science, computers, and the arts. Most of the Honors classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP) classes. A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered. Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered to all 2nd grade students in the district. This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered. Parents may request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes. The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge. Gifted Education records: All Gifted Education records are confidential and are kept in the Gifted Education Office. Parents of students who move out of district must submit a request for records to the Gifted Education Office, Moore Public Schools, 1500 S. E. 4th Street, Moore, OK 73160.

Proficiency Based Promotion Testing Proficiency based promotion tests are provided for Moore Public School students who wish to show proficiency in a course they have not taken. Qualifying students are those who are legally enrolled in the local school district. Tests are for year-long curriculum; we do not provide one-semester exams. Students may have the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the core subject areas. Criteria for advancing to the next level will be demonstrated by a score of 90% or better. The proficiency test dates for next year are: 2024-2025 Test date May 29, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year – applications due April 29, 2025 Test date August 25, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year– applications due July 25, 2025 All tests will be administered at the Administrative Service Center. High school students must bring a photo ID on the day of testing. Application must be received three weeks prior to test date. Applications may be obtained from the student's school counselor or printed here , and must be signed by both the principal and counselor, as well as the parent or guardian if the student is a minor. A copy of the student's transcript must be included with the application. If proficiency is shown, appropriate notation will be made for elementary, middle level or high school level students satisfactorily completing a 9-12 high school curriculum area. This unit will count toward meeting the requirements for the high school diploma. To download the Oklahoma State Regulations concerning Proficiency Based Promotion, click here: PBP Regulations .

School cancellation decisions of any kind are made on a case-by-case basis after district officials assess the potential impact on district operations. MPS considerations include, but are not limited to, the items listed below, all of which could prevent students and staff from accessing a safe and meaningful learning environment: The anticipated impact on bus routes The impact on campus facilities, including electricity, heat, water, internet, and child nutrition The possible impacts on staffing MPS also considers how many banked minutes we have reserved to utilize for inclement weather days before the district would be required to make up instructional days/time as required by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Please note that all of our banked minutes have been used for weather events during the fall 2024 semester. Therefore, our options are to utilize Virtual Learning Days or extend the school year past May 16. Each year, Oklahoma students are required to complete 1,080 instructional hours.

                    "Schools across the nation receive funding based on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Information below comes from the Federal Department of Education, ed.gov . What is ESEA? Fifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education. Act (ESEA) of 1965. The law represented a major new commitment by the federal government to “quality and equality” in educating our young people. When President Johnson sent the bill to Congress, he urged that the country, “declare a national goal of full educational opportunity.” The purpose of ESEA was to provide additional resources for vulnerable students. ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, created special education centers, and created scholarships for low-income college students. The law also provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education. In the 35 years following ESEA, the federal government increased the amount of resources dedicated to education. However, education remains a local issue. The federal government remained committed to ensuring that disadvantaged students had additional resources, however, because as a nation we were falling short of meeting the law’s original goal of full educational opportunity. Federal Program Complaint Procedure: The district an established a complaint process to help ensure compliance with federal grant requirements. Any student, parent, community member or employee who believes the district has violated any regulation connected with the expenditure of federal funds should notify the district using the process outlined in the following link: Complaint policy To report fraud, waste, abuse, misuse or mismanagement of U.S. Department of Education (ED) program funds (this could include complaints concerning employees, fund recipients, educational institutions, contractors, collection agencies, or lending institutions), please contact the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education Hotline.

ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, created special education centers, and created scholarships for low-income college students. The law also provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education.",
                    "In the 35 years following ESEA, the federal government increased the amount of resources dedicated to education. However, education remains a local issue. The federal government remained committed to ensuring that disadvantaged students had additional resources, however, because as a nation we were falling short of meeting the law’s original goal of full educational opportunity.",
                    "Federal Program Complaint Procedure: The district an established a complaint process to help ensure compliance with federal grant requirements. Any student, parent, community member or employee who believes the district has violated any regulation connected with the expenditure of federal funds should notify the district using the process outlined in the following link: Complaint policy",
                    "To report fraud, waste, abuse, misuse or mismanagement of U.S. Department of Education (ED) program funds (this could include complaints concerning employees, fund recipients, educational institutions, contractors, collection agencies, or lending institutions), please contact the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education Hotline.

                    "Moore Public Schools is committed to protecting your child's education records. Our school district is continuing to develop comprehensive policies to comply with federal and state student privacy laws and regulations. Protecting data collected about your child and how it is used to enhance his or her learning experience in our schools is significant responsibility and trust given to our school officials. Our district and schools collect data including PII information defined in Oklahoma HB 2618 including scores on tests and assignments, report card grades, student attendance, demographics, information on special needs, graduation and remediation rates, and disciplinary actions. This data is used to determine eligibility for services, help teachers and school leaders understand what is or is not helping children succeed and to personalize instruction to improve student achievement. While schools and school districts have always collected student data, the creation, storage and analysis of this information has increasingly moved to digital formats online. As a result, we have a strict student data privacy policy in place that details the procedures and security mechanics in place to protect student data consistent with Oklahoma Department of Education Data Privacy and Security practices. The policy also outlines restrictions on authorized users who are permitted to access students data. Access to personally identifiable data about your child is limited to those with a legitimate educational interest in their data, meaning that individuals within the district only have access to the data they need in order to do their job. This data will never be sold or shared for marketing or commercial purposes, and will only be used to improve how our students learn and succeed. STUDENT DATA PRIVACY KEY MESSAGES Key Messages for Parents 1) Student data is carefully safeguarded through school and district policies and procedures, as well as state and federal privacy laws that are specifically designed to protect student data. 2) Individuals within the district only have access to the identifiable data they need in order to carry out the responsibilities of their job. 3) We collect data including scores on tests and assignments, report card grades, attendance, demographics, information on special needs, graduation and remediation rates, and disciplinary actions. This data is used to determine eligibility for services and to personalize lesson plans for learning and thereby improve student achievement. 4) Our schools, school districts, and technology partners are subject to strict penalties under law if student information is misused or compromised. 5) Information collected about your child's learning helps our teachers and schools enhance his/her educational experience to ensure student success. Key Messages from Teachers 1) Our access to personally identifiable data about student learning is limited to those students with whom we work. 2) As teachers, we are trained and committed to protect the student’s data we can access. 3) Student data allows us to personalize lesson plans and assignments and select the right learning tools and content for each student. Key Messages from School & District Administrators 1) Our district recognizes that the security of student data is of the utmost importance and we serve as the frontline in the protection of student data. 2) Our school/district has a comprehensive student data privacy policy that outlines processes and security mechanisms that protect student data and also governs who has access to data and how it can be used. 3) Access to personally identifiable information is restricted to trained, qualified people, and they only have access to the specific data they need to do their jobs. 4) Student data helps principals and school district administrators make important decisions on how to best serve our students. We limit the data we collect to only that which is necessary for us to provide students with an effective education. Key Messages from Local School Board Members 1) As leaders elected to oversee our community's school system, we are committed to protecting and securing student data. 2) It is our duty to ensure the school district and its employees are upholding all existing federal and state student privacy protection laws, and we take that responsibility very seriously. 3) Aggregated student data allows our board to make informed decisions on the allocation of resources and establishment of new programs that will enhance student learning.",

Board Policies and Laws Governing Student Transfers MPS District Policy - MPS Board Policy 7070 70 O.S. §1-114 70 O.S. §1-113 70 O.S. §5-117.1 70 O.S. §8-101, et seq. 70 O.S. §8-113 70 O.S. §8-103.2 70 O.S. §13-103 70 O.S. §24-101, et seq.; §24-102 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act Atty. Gen. Op. No. 87-134, April 1, 1988 Transfer Overview & Timeline The school district will not accept or deny a transfer based on ethnicity, national origin, gender, income level, disabling condition, proficiency in the English language, measure of achievement, aptitude or athletic ability. The Oklahoma State Department of Education will begin accepting applications for the next school year beginning June 1 ( on the OSDE website ). Receipt of applications will be documented by the district so that the district may review those applications in the order submitted for purposes of capacity limitations. The administration will not approve or deny transfers received for the next school year until after the July 1 capacity data is determined for each grade level and site within the school district. Transfers that have previously been approved by the school district will remain in effect for future school years unless the district provides notification to the parent or legal guardian that the transfer is not going to be continued for an upcoming school year due to capacity, disciplinary action, or attendance issues. The district will not require parents to resubmit a new application each school year and will advance the previous application of an enrolled student, amending only the grade placement of the student. A transfer may be requested at any time in the school year. State law does limit the ability of a student to transfer no more than two (2) times per school year to one or more school districts in which the student does not reside. Exceptions to this limit will exist for students in foster care. Students are legally entitled to re-enroll at any time in his or her school district of residence. A separate application must be filed for each student in the same family wishing to transfer so that the district can timely consider requests in the order applications are received. It is the policy of the board of education that any legally transferring student shall be accepted by the district under the following circumstances: 1. The district has the capacity to accept students at the grade level at the school site; 2. The transferring student has not been disciplined for: a. violation of a school regulation, b. possession of an intoxicating beverage, low-point beer, as defined by Section 163.2 of Title 37 of the Oklahoma Statutes, or missing or stolen property if the property is reasonably suspected to have been taken from a student, a school employee, or the school during school activities, or c. possession of a dangerous weapon or a controlled dangerous substance while on or within two thousand (2,000) feet of public-school property, or at a school event, as defined in the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. 3. The transferring student does not have a history of absences. “History of absences” means ten or more absences in one semester that are not excused for the reasons provided in 70 O.S. § 10-105 or due to illness. By the first day of January, April, July, and October, the board of education shall establish the number of transfer students the district has the capacity to accept in each grade level for each school site within the district. The number of transfer students for each grade level at each site that the district has the capacity to accept will be posted in a prominent place on the school district’s website. The district shall report to the State Department of Education the number of transfer students for each grade level for each school site which the district has the capacity to accept. Capacity Determination The following calculations will be used to determine Program Capacity For grades PK through grade 1, student capacity is set at 16 students per classroom. For grades 2-6, student capacity is set at 20 students per classroom. For grades 7-12, capacity is set based on student enrollment in the regular education required core classes for each grade level. The student capacity is set at 24 students. Transfer of Certified Employee's Children A student shall be allowed to transfer to a district in which the parent or legal guardian of the student is employed as a certified teacher as per 70 O.S. § 8-113. Dependent Children of Active Duty Military Students who are the dependent children of a member of the active uniformed military services of the United States on full-time active-duty status and students who are the dependent children of the military reserve on active duty orders shall be eligible for admission to the school district regardless of capacity of the district. Students shall be eligible for military transfer if: 1. At least one parent of the student has a Department of Defense issued identification card; and 2. At least one parent can provide evidence that he or she will be on active-duty status or active-duty orders, meaning the parent will be temporarily transferred in compliance with official orders to another location in support of combat, contingency operation or a national disaster requiring the use of orders for more than thirty (30) consecutive days. If accepted, a student transfer is granted for the existing school year and may continue to attend in future years. At the end of the school year, the district may deny continued transfer of the student due to capacity or for disciplinary reasons or a history of absences. Transfer Acceptance Transfers that have previously been approved by the school district will remain in effect for future school years unless the district provides notification to the parent or legal guardian that the transfer is not going to be continued for an upcoming school year due to capacity, disciplinary action or attendance issues. The district will not require parents to resubmit a new application each school year and will advance the previous application of an enrolled student, amending only the grade placement of the student. Transfer Denial and Appeal Process If a transfer request is denied by the administration, the parent or legal guardian of the student may appeal the denial within ten (10) days of notification of denial to the board of education. The board of education shall consider the appeal at its next regularly scheduled board meeting if notice is provided prior to the statutory deadline for posting the agenda for the meeting. If notice is after the deadline for posting, the board shall consider the appeal at the next regular meeting of the board of education. If the board of education votes to uphold the denial of the transfer, the parent or legal guardian may appeal the denial within ten (10) days of the notification of the appeal denial to the State Board of Education. The parent or legal guardian shall submit to the State Board of Education and to the Superintendent of Moore Public Schools, a notice of appeal on the form prescribed by the State Board of Education.

Transportation Parents/legal guardians of transferred students must provide transportation to and from school."
