This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered.

The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge.

Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive field trips, and Summer Camps.) The purpose of the secondary gifted education program is to provide educational opportunities modified in pace, depth, and breadth in individual subject areas. Honors and Advanced Placement classes are offered in language, math, social studies, science, computers, and the arts. Most of the Honors classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP) classes. A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered. Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered to all 2nd grade students in the district. This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered. Parents may request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes. The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge. Gifted Education records: All Gifted Education records are confidential and are kept in the Gifted Education Office. Parents of students who move out of district must submit a request for records to the Gifted Education Office, Moore Public Schools, 1500 S. E. 4th Street, Moore, OK 73160.

Qualifying students are those who are legally enrolled in the local school district. Tests are for year-long curriculum; we do not provide one-semester exams. Students may have the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the core subject areas. Criteria for advancing to the next level will be demonstrated by a score of 90% or better. The proficiency test dates for next year are: 2024-2025 Test date May 29, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year â applications due April 29, 2025 Test date August 25, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school yearâ applications due July 25, 2025 All tests will be administered at the Administrative Service Center. High school students must bring a photo ID on the day of testing. Application must be received three weeks prior to test date. Applications may be obtained from the student's school counselor or printed here , and must be signed by both the principal and counselor, as well as the parent or guardian if the student is a minor. A copy of the student's transcript must be included with the application. If proficiency is shown, appropriate notation will be made for elementary, middle level or high school level students satisfactorily completing a 9-12 high school curriculum area. This unit will count toward meeting the requirements for the high school diploma. To download the Oklahoma State Regulations concerning Proficiency Based Promotion, click here: PBP Regulations .

                    "AP is a rigorous academic program built on the commitment, passion, and hard work of students and educators from both secondary schools and higher education. Since 1955, the AP Program has enabled millions of students to take college-level courses and exams, and to earn college credit or placement while still in high school. A 2008 study found that AP students had better four-year graduation rates than those who did not take AP. For example, graduation rates for AP English Literature students were 62 percent higher than graduation rates for those who took other English courses in high school. Taking AP also increases eligibility for scholarships and makes candidates more attractive to colleges.

                    "The gifted education program in Moore includes elementary students identified through a variety of measurement methods, junior high pre-AP students, and high school pre-AP and AP students. Third through sixth grade gifted students are served through differentiated instruction within the regular classroom as well as opportunities outside of the traditional school setting (Saturday Academies, immersive field trips, and Summer Camps.) The purpose of the secondary gifted education program is to provide educational opportunities modified in pace, depth, and breadth in individual subject areas. Honors and Advanced Placement classes are offered in language, math, social studies, science, computers, and the arts. Most of the Honors classes have been aligned with the College Board curriculum taught and tested in the Advanced Placement (AP) classes. A wide variety of Advanced Placement classes are offered. Check the course offerings at each high school for specific courses. The Cognitive Abilities Test is administered to all 2nd grade students in the district. This test and the state OCCT results are the basis for most recommendations into the gifted program. In addition to test scores, teacher and parent recommendations are considered. Parents may request placement in the pre-AP and AP classes. The placement guidelines reflect the Advanced Placement philosophy that Advanced Placement should be available to all students who want to achieve at a high level and are willing to accept the challenge. Gifted Education records: All Gifted Education records are confidential and are kept in the Gifted Education Office. Parents of students who move out of district must submit a request for records to the Gifted Education Office, Moore Public Schools, 1500 S. E. 4th Street, Moore, OK 73160.

Proficiency Based Promotion Testing Proficiency based promotion tests are provided for Moore Public School students who wish to show proficiency in a course they have not taken. Qualifying students are those who are legally enrolled in the local school district. Tests are for year-long curriculum; we do not provide one-semester exams. Students may have the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in the core subject areas. Criteria for advancing to the next level will be demonstrated by a score of 90% or better. The proficiency test dates for next year are: 2024-2025 Test date May 29, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school year â applications due April 29, 2025 Test date August 25, 2025 for the 2024-2025 school yearâ applications due July 25, 2025 All tests will be administered at the Administrative Service Center. High school students must bring a photo ID on the day of testing. Application must be received three weeks prior to test date. Applications may be obtained from the student's school counselor or printed here , and must be signed by both the principal and counselor, as well as the parent or guardian if the student is a minor. A copy of the student's transcript must be included with the application. If proficiency is shown, appropriate notation will be made for elementary, middle level or high school level students satisfactorily completing a 9-12 high school curriculum area. This unit will count toward meeting the requirements for the high school diploma. To download the Oklahoma State Regulations concerning Proficiency Based Promotion, click here: PBP Regulations .

Below is how the district makes school cancellation decisions and the communication sources we use to relay important information. School cancellation decisions of any kind are made on a case-by-case basis after district officials assess the potential impact on district operations. MPS considerations include, but are not limited to, the items listed below, all of which could prevent students and staff from accessing a safe and meaningful learning environment: The anticipated impact on bus routes The impact on campus facilities, including electricity, heat, water, internet, and child nutrition The possible impacts on staffing MPS also considers how many banked minutes we have reserved to utilize for inclement weather days before the district would be required to make up instructional days/time as required by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Please note that all of our banked minutes have been used for weather events during the fall 2024 semester. Therefore, our options are to utilize Virtual Learning Days or extend the school year past May 16. Each year, Oklahoma students are required to complete 1,080 instructional hours.

The awards program saw more than 100 communications professionals from around the U.S. serve as judges, using a set of established criteria based on industry best practices.",
                    "MPS Communications Director Anna Aguilar employed Contract Artist and Graphic Designer Jason Graham and together they did the research and analysis to develop a new district logo after 22 years of the former mark.",
                    "\"The new logo represents every aspect of our district; each employee, student, resource and program. They are all reflected in our new mark. Our logo represents all of us and I'm proud to have worked with Dr. Robert Romines and my colleague and friend Jason to make this logo a reality for MPS,\" said Aguilar.",

What is ESEA? Fifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education. Act (ESEA) of 1965. The law represented a major new commitment by the federal government to âquality and equalityâ in educating our young people. When President Johnson sent the bill to Congress, he urged that the country, âdeclare a national goal of full educational opportunity.â The purpose of ESEA was to provide additional resources for vulnerable students. ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, created special education centers, and created scholarships for low-income college students. The law also provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education. In the 35 years following ESEA, the federal government increased the amount of resources dedicated to education. However, education remains a local issue. The federal government remained committed to ensuring that disadvantaged students had additional resources, however, because as a nation we were falling short of meeting the lawâs original goal of full educational opportunity. Federal Program Complaint Procedure: The district an established a complaint process to help ensure compliance with federal grant requirements. Any student, parent, community member or employee who believes the district has violated any regulation connected with the expenditure of federal funds should notify the district using the process outlined in the following link: Complaint policy To report fraud, waste, abuse, misuse or mismanagement of U.S. Department of Education (ED) program funds (this could include complaints concerning employees, fund recipients, educational institutions, contractors, collection agencies, or lending institutions), please contact the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education Hotline.

                    "Moore Public Schools is committed to protecting your child's education records. Our school district is continuing to develop comprehensive policies to comply with federal and state student privacy laws and regulations. Protecting data collected about your child and how it is used to enhance his or her learning experience in our schools is significant responsibility and trust given to our school officials. Our district and schools collect data including PII information defined in Oklahoma HB 2618 including scores on tests and assignments, report card grades, student attendance, demographics, information on special needs, graduation and remediation rates, and disciplinary actions. This data is used to determine eligibility for services, help teachers and school leaders understand what is or is not helping children succeed and to personalize instruction to improve student achievement. While schools and school districts have always collected student data, the creation, storage and analysis of this information has increasingly moved to digital formats online. As a result, we have a strict student data privacy policy in place that details the procedures and security mechanics in place to protect student data consistent with Oklahoma Department of Education Data Privacy and Security practices. The policy also outlines restrictions on authorized users who are permitted to access students data. Access to personally identifiable data about your child is limited to those with a legitimate educational interest in their data, meaning that individuals within the district only have access to the data they need in order to do their job. This data will never be sold or shared for marketing or commercial purposes, and will only be used to improve how our students learn and succeed. STUDENT DATA PRIVACY KEY MESSAGES Key Messages for Parents 1) Student data is carefully safeguarded through school and district policies and procedures, as well as state and federal privacy laws that are specifically designed to protect student data. 2) Individuals within the district only have access to the identifiable data they need in order to carry out the responsibilities of their job. 3) We collect data including scores on tests and assignments, report card grades, attendance, demographics, information on special needs, graduation and remediation rates, and disciplinary actions. This data is used to determine eligibility for services and to personalize lesson plans for learning and thereby improve student achievement. 4) Our schools, school districts, and technology partners are subject to strict penalties under law if student information is misused or compromised. 5) Information collected about your child's learning helps our teachers and schools enhance his/her educational experience to ensure student success. Key Messages from Teachers 1) Our access to personally identifiable data about student learning is limited to those students with whom we work. 2) As teachers, we are trained and committed to protect the studentâs data we can access. 3) Student data allows us to personalize lesson plans and assignments and select the right learning tools and content for each student. Key Messages from School & District Administrators 1) Our district recognizes that the security of student data is of the utmost importance and we serve as the frontline in the protection of student data. 2) Our school/district has a comprehensive student data privacy policy that outlines processes and security mechanisms that protect student data and also governs who has access to data and how it can be used. 3) Access to personally identifiable information is restricted to trained, qualified people, and they only have access to the specific data they need to do their jobs. 4) Student data helps principals and school district administrators make important decisions on how to best serve our students. We limit the data we collect to only that which is necessary for us to provide students with an effective education. Key Messages from Local School Board Members 1) As leaders elected to oversee our community's school system, we are committed to protecting and securing student data. 2) It is our duty to ensure the school district and its employees are upholding all existing federal and state student privacy protection laws, and we take that responsibility very seriously. 3) Aggregated student data allows our board to make informed decisions on the allocation of resources and establishment of new programs that will enhance student learning.",

                    "Moore Public Schools offers a variety of opportunities for students who need a learning environment other than the regular school setting. VISTA High School is designed for students in grades 9 through 12 who have not been successful in the regular school setting. These students may be dropouts, students needing transition between treatment centers or suspensions and traditional school, and/or students who have not been successful academically. Our VISTA Academy High School curriculum is based on district and state content standards and adheres to the structure delineated by the Oklahoma Academic Standards. The program creates a school in which parents, staff, and students choose to participate because the program honors individualâs differences, values diverse populations, and is committed to ensuring the educational success of all students. VISTA Academy for 7th and 8th grade is designed for students who are identified as at-risk or who have already dropped out of school. The program is designed for students who need extra individual assistance in an alternative setting. The seventh and eighth grade program serves the six junior high schools. This is a full-day program and students are expected to attend full-time and on a long-term basis (e.g., from their entry date to the end of the school year. Candidates must sign a written agreement with school officials and parents). The VISTA 6th Grade Program is designed for students who are identified as at-risk or who have already dropped out of school. The program is designed for students who need extra individual assistance in an alternative setting. The 6th grade program is housed at Santa Fe Elementary and serves all 25 elementary schools in our district. This is a full-day program and students are expected to attend full-time and on a long-term basis (e.g., from their entry date to the end of the school year. Candidates must sign a written agreement with school officials and their parents or guardians). Moore Schools' VISTA MAST Program is a dropout and credit recovery program that provides a full-day program for academics and counseling to students in grades 7-12 and ages 13 to 17. Students in this program have not been successful in regular school settings and may have been involved with local juvenile authorities, and/or been suspended on a long-term basis. Family mental health and substance use/abuse counseling are integral components of this program and are provided through interagency agreements with Moore Youth and Family Services, Inc. Student eligibility is determined by a comprehensive intake process. One full-time Certified Teacher, one full-time office assistant, two program coordinators with clinical backgrounds, and one full-time counselor work with and closely supervise each student. Moore Night School is another dropout and credit recovery program designed for students who have dropped out of school and have a desire to return to pursue graduation requirements, as well as seniors lacking credits to graduate on time. These students may be on long-term suspension, drug/alcohol suspension, referred by the juvenile justice system, have academic deficiencies, and/or have needs which are not met in the traditional classroom setting. This program meets four nights a week, with five hours of instruction available each night. Although the five programs differ with regard to particular design, targeted population and areas of emphasis, the goals and expectations are similar: Reduce the dropout rate Retrieve dropouts to empower them to get back on track to graduate Reduce chronic absenteeism Raise individual grade point averages Increase the number of courses passed per semester per student Improve behavior and attitude toward education Raise standardized test scores Increase our district graduation rate VISTA Academy: Alternative School 224 SE 4th St Moore, OK 73160 Phone: 405-735-4640 School website",

                    "When spring weather approaches, Moore Public Schools uses its safety procedures and weather plans. Thanks to our MPS Patrons and community who supported the 2015 bond issue, all students have access to a storm shelter. Per state law, MPS students follow tornado safety guidelines at all schools and practice fire drills, intruder drills, and tornado drills throughout the year. Any time there is a risk of severe tornadic weather, we will follow our District Tornado Sheltering Plan as follows: If a severe weather watch or warning is issued while students are in school, parents/guardians have the option of picking up/checking out their student and receiving an excused absence. If someone other than the parent/guardian is checking out a student, ensure your childâs school has the correct non-parent emergency contact information on file. Buses will be held at schools or the nearest safe location when immediate severe weather is expected. If the severe weather is unexpected and a bus is en route, drivers will seek safety at the nearest school. Additionally: Â· Each school has a crisis intervention team and a written crisis plan that outlines procedures regarding safety concerns/intruders, severe weather/tornado, gas leaks, fire, etc. Â· The Office of the Superintendent, the Safety and Security Office, and other district officials are in contact with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Norman when severe weather is anticipated. This occurs through a live feed between the NWS and the MPS Administration. The live feed allows for real-time questions and answers about storm fronts, and weather-related alerts and issues. Â· The MPS Administration utilizes the districtwide emergency radio system to immediately communicate with school principals and departments, individually and/or simultaneously. Â· Should a weather incident occur during school hours we will communicate with families using the email and mobile contact numbers listed for your student in Infinite Campus. Moore Public Schools uses the following outlets to send information to families: ParentSquare (PSQ) Primary source for messaging Email, phone and text messages (families & staff) MPS website : mooreschools.com Local news media : KFOR-4 KOCO-5 KWTV-9 KOKH-25 Social media (Only when necessary.

                "content": [
                    "Whenever Evan got in trouble at school, he knew what to expect â heâd be sent home. A few days, sometimes weeks, removed from classes and left to navigate online assignments on his own. Every time, it felt like a step further away from graduating.",
                    "KOSU is only using Evanâs first name in this story as heâs a minor discussing school discipline.",
                    "âIt wasnât working to just suspend me and send me home because, I mean, I would come back with failing grades,â he said. âI wasnât doing nothing.â",
                    "By the time he reached his freshman year at Westmoore High School, that cycle had escalated. A 45-day suspension loomed, and Evan braced for more of the same â isolation, slipping grades and the growing sense that school might not be for him.",
                    "But last fall, Moore Public Schools tried something different. Instead of being sent home, Evan was part of the first group of students sent to the districtâs new Suspension Transition and Education Program, or STEP.",
                    "STEP principal Jerry Broadbent said he still has a picture of the programâs first cohort on his phone. Now, almost 180 students have been sent to STEP.",
                    "âThat group, two years ago, we're sending them home, pass rate was right around 50%,â Broadbent said. âThe kids came through our program last year, the pass rate was at 80% for the semester.â",
                    "STEP accepts 7th through 10th graders across the district who have been suspended for the same amount of time as Evan, pooling students from three high schools, six junior high schools and an alternative school, VISTA Academy.",
                    "Instead of being sent home, STEP brings suspended students together in a structured environment with strict rules, academic support and therapy. Located in an industrial metal building in central Moore that has been converted into the districtâs hub for night school and alternative learning programs, STEP is a stark difference from what normal suspension looks like.",
                    "But itâs a change students like Evan acknowledge they need.",
                    "âHonestly, now that I look back at it, it wasnât working. Like, just sending me home was not working. I wasnât doing none of my work,â Evan said. âI was getting grounded but I was still doing whatever I wanted because I just wasnât listening to nobody.â",
                    "Long-term suspensions can have substantial negative effects on students, starting them on a path to the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities and can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and dropouts. According to the ACLU, all of these factors increase a studentâs likelihood of court involvement.",
                    "The isolation that comes with being sent home, especially to an unhealthy environment, and the embarrassment of a public punishment can also negatively impact a studentâs mental health.",
                    "But without other options, many schools still turn to suspension as a form of discipline. In the 2020-21 school year, Moore Public Schools suspended more students than the national and state averages.",
                    "Broadbent said Moore realized it could use those suspensions to target a group that needs extra support, especially because a majority of the students who come to STEP got in trouble for drug possession.",
                    "âIf you got kids who are gonna be suspended, youâve got a little bit of a captive audience and thatâs a great time you can hit them with those short-term interventions,â he said.",
                    "Broadbent said the district started STEP because research recommends early interventions for students struggling with substance abuse and part of the programâs funds come from opioid abatement grants from the state.",
                    "Suspension also disproportionately affects minority students, who are more likely to receive punishment than their white counterparts. In Moore during the 2020-21 school year, 7.76% of American Indian or Alaska Native students and 8.21% of Black or African American students have one or more out-of-school suspensions. Meanwhile, only 3.02% of white students have one or more out-of-school suspensions.",
                    "Students at STEP take classes, spend all day without access to their phones and are under complete adult supervision. Broadbent said these measures keep students safe and on track.",
                    "STEP is still a consequence for students who get in trouble, but with integrated support and a team of adults who want ânothing better than [their] success,â he said.",
                    "One of those adults is Summer King â a licensed therapist working on-site at STEP.",
                    "Kingâs office is bright blue, decorated with colorful signs and filled with fidget toys and trinkets. She said she designed it with students and their comfort in mind because she knows how scary it can feel to trust someone with your feelings.",
                    "Before coming to STEP, Evan said he spent most of his life avoiding conversations about his emotions. Family members and teachers had suggested he seek out therapy or counseling during his freshman year âbecause of a lot of the things that were happening in his life,â but he was resistant to the idea.",
                    "King said even students like Evan, who may be hesitant to get support, can end up leaning into the therapy portion of STEP.",
                    "âIt helped me learn how to talk about my problems with my aunt when I feel like sheâs making me mad or whatever, or when Iâm having a tough time in class, I talk to the teacher, âcan I step out?ââ Evan said. âAnd then for my social skills, man.â",
                    "Brandy Gomez, the mother of a different student sent to STEP at the same time as Evan, said the âwarmth, care and dedicationâ educators showed her son was beyond anything sheâd ever seen, especially for suspended students.",
                    "âIâve never seen a program like this before, I mean, itâs amazing though because Iâve seen so many students go down the drain just because they got suspended and they just drop out and move on with life,â Gomez said. âThey stepped in and tried to help us in one of his hardest times.â",
                    "She worries there isnât time for individualized support in the rush of a normal school day and that teachers donât have the same capacity for care because they are looking after so many students with different needs at the same time.",
                    "She said, after her son finished the program, the two of them even considered finding a low-level way for him to get in trouble again so he could be sent back to STEP.",
                    "âThese people are the ones who made a difference in his life,â she said.",
                    "Broadbent said students who come to STEP have often already been punished at school. And many, if not all, have problems at home or personal struggles that contributed to the behavior they were suspended for.",
                    "âEvery kid that comes in here,â he said, âtheyâre carrying some baggage with them.â",
                    "According to King, STEP is about discipline, not punishment.",
                    "âIf people learned only from the negative potential consequences, none of us would ever get a speeding ticket, none of us would ever have had issues that we regret later in our life,â she said. âThis is focusing on their future and all of the things they have left to come.â",
                    "She said STEP is not only about filling the time most students spend âwaiting outâ their 45-day suspensions, but she hopes students leave the program with more resources and confidence.",
                    "Broadbent said he designed the program to make transitioning back to school easier than normal suspension. The program includes daily in-person attendance requirements and class materials that more closely mirror what students are missing.",
                    "He grew up going to school in Moore and coached football in the district for 27 years, but he says his last year at STEP has been one of the most rewarding during his whole career.",
                    "âI love the fact that â¦ we got these crazy political climates, you know, and having care and compassion and caring about kids has no political party,â he said. âPolitically, me and Ms. Summer [King] are probably the most diverse people that you could ever find, but we work together so well because the focus is these kids.â",
                    "Evanâs time at STEP had a profound effect on him. He said he owes his growth to the program.",
                    "âI canât even tell you where Iâd be right now, Iâd probably be with a lot of my friends to be honest and theyâre not really in good places,â Evan said. âI feel like if it wasnât for STEP, some of the choices and decisions that I decided not to make, I wouldaâ made.â",
                    "He said educators at STEP saw him, and students like him, as more than just their mistakes.",
                    "âI feel like they all understood us on different levels when other people couldnât,â Evan said. âI feel like they seen through our anger and our moods and feelings and worked with us until we were feeling better and didnât let our anger or whatever, like, make them just walk out on us.â"
