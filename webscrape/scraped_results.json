            "What is ESEA?",
            "Fifty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education. Act (ESEA) of 1965. The law represented a major new commitment by the federal government to “quality and equality” in educating our young people. When President Johnson sent the bill to Congress, he urged that the country, “declare a national goal of full educational opportunity.” The purpose of ESEA was to provide additional resources for vulnerable students. ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, created special education centers, and created scholarships for low-income college students. The law also provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education.",
            "In the 35 years following ESEA, the federal government increased the amount of resources dedicated to education. However, education remains a local issue. The federal government remained committed to ensuring that disadvantaged students had additional resources, however, because as a nation we were falling short of meeting the law’s original goal of full educational opportunity.",
            "Federal Program Complaint Procedure:",
            "The district an established a complaint process to help ensure compliance with federal grant requirements. Any student, parent, community member or employee who believes the district has violated any regulation connected with the expenditure of federal funds should notify the district using the process outlined in the following link:",

            "Whenever Evan got in trouble at school, he knew what to expect — he’d be sent home. A few days, sometimes weeks, removed from classes and left to navigate online assignments on his own. Every time, it felt like a step further away from graduating.",
            "KOSU is only using Evan’s first name in this story as he’s a minor discussing school discipline.",
            "“It wasn’t working to just suspend me and send me home because, I mean, I would come back with failing grades,” he said. “I wasn’t doing nothing.”",
            "By the time he reached his freshman year at Westmoore High School, that cycle had escalated. A 45-day suspension loomed, and Evan braced for more of the same – isolation, slipping grades and the growing sense that school might not be for him.",
            "But last fall, Moore Public Schools tried something different. Instead of being sent home, Evan was part of the first group of students sent to the district’s new Suspension Transition and Education Program, or STEP.",
            "STEP principal Jerry Broadbent said he still has a picture of the program’s first cohort on his phone. Now, almost 180 students have been sent to STEP.",
            "“That group, two years ago, we're sending them home, pass rate was right around 50%,” Broadbent said. “The kids came through our program last year, the pass rate was at 80% for the semester.”",
            "An alternative to suspension",
            "STEP accepts 7th through 10th graders across the district who have been suspended for the same amount of time as Evan, pooling students from three high schools, six junior high schools and an alternative school, VISTA Academy.",
            "Instead of being sent home, STEP brings suspended students together in a structured environment with strict rules, academic support and therapy. Located in an industrial metal building in central Moore that has been converted into the district’s hub for night school and alternative learning programs, STEP is a stark difference from what normal suspension looks like.",
            "But it’s a change students like Evan acknowledge they need.",
            "“Honestly, now that I look back at it, it wasn’t working. Like, just sending me home was not working. I wasn’t doing none of my work,” Evan said. “I was getting grounded but I was still doing whatever I wanted because I just wasn’t listening to nobody.”",
            "Long-term suspensions can have substantial negative effects on students, starting them on a path to the juvenile justice system. Suspended and expelled children are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities and can easily fall behind in their coursework, leading to a greater likelihood of disengagement and dropouts.",
            "According to the ACLU",
            ", all of these factors increase a student’s likelihood of court involvement.",
            "The isolation that comes with being sent home, especially to an unhealthy environment, and the embarrassment of a public punishment can also negatively impact a student’s mental health.",
            "But without other options, many schools still turn to suspension as a form of discipline. In the",
            "2020-21 school year",
            ", Moore Public Schools suspended more students than the national and state averages.",
            "Broadbent said Moore realized it could use those suspensions to target a group that needs extra support, especially because a majority of the students who come to STEP got in trouble for drug possession.",
            "“If you got kids who are gonna be suspended, you’ve got a little bit of a captive audience and that’s a great time you can hit them with those short-term interventions,” he said.",
            "Broadbent said the district started STEP because research recommends early interventions for students struggling with substance abuse and part of the program’s funds come from",
            "opioid abatement grants",
            "from the state.",
            "Suspension also disproportionately affects minority students, who are more likely to receive punishment than their white counterparts. In Moore during the 2020-21 school year, 7.76% of American Indian or Alaska Native students and 8.21% of Black or African American students have one or more out-of-school suspensions. Meanwhile, only 3.02% of white students have one or more out-of-school suspensions.",
            "Integrated support",
            "Students at STEP take classes, spend all day without access to their phones and are under complete adult supervision. Broadbent said these measures keep students safe and on track.",
            "STEP is still a consequence for students who get in trouble, but with integrated support and a team of adults who want “nothing better than [their] success,” he said.",
            "One of those adults is Summer King – a licensed therapist working on-site at STEP.",
            "King’s office is bright blue, decorated with colorful signs and filled with fidget toys and trinkets. She said she designed it with students and their comfort in mind because she knows how scary it can feel to trust someone with your feelings.",
            "Before coming to STEP, Evan said he spent most of his life avoiding conversations about his emotions. Family members and teachers had suggested he seek out therapy or counseling during his freshman year “because of a lot of the things that were happening in his life,” but he was resistant to the idea.",
            "King said even students like Evan, who may be hesitant to get support, can end up leaning into the therapy portion of STEP.",
            "“It helped me learn how to talk about my problems with my aunt when I feel like she’s making me mad or whatever, or when I’m having a tough time in class, I talk to the teacher, ‘can I step out?’” Evan said. “And then for my social skills, man.”",
            "Brandy Gomez, the mother of a different student sent to STEP at the same time as Evan, said the “warmth, care and dedication” educators showed her son was beyond anything she’d ever seen, especially for suspended students.",
            "“I’ve never seen a program like this before, I mean, it’s amazing though because I’ve seen so many students go down the drain just because they got suspended and they just drop out and move on with life,” Gomez said. “They stepped in and tried to help us in one of his hardest times.”",
            "She worries there isn’t time for individualized support in the rush of a normal school day and that teachers don’t have the same capacity for care because they are looking after so many students with different needs at the same time.",
            "She said, after her son finished the program, the two of them even considered finding a low-level way for him to get in trouble again so he could be sent back to STEP.",
            "“These people are the ones who made a difference in his life,” she said.",
            "Broadbent said students who come to STEP have often already been punished at school. And many, if not all, have problems at home or personal struggles that contributed to the behavior they were suspended for.",
            "“Every kid that comes in here,” he said, “they’re carrying some baggage with them.”",
            "Resources to grow",
            "According to King, STEP is about discipline, not punishment.",
            "“If people learned only from the negative potential consequences, none of us would ever get a speeding ticket, none of us would ever have had issues that we regret later in our life,” she said. “This is focusing on their future and all of the things they have left to come.”",
            "She said STEP is not only about filling the time most students spend “waiting out” their 45-day suspensions, but she hopes students leave the program with more resources and confidence.",
            "Broadbent said he designed the program to make transitioning back to school easier than normal suspension. The program includes daily in-person attendance requirements and class materials that more closely mirror what students are missing.",
            "He grew up going to school in Moore and coached football in the district for 27 years, but he says his last year at STEP has been one of the most rewarding during his whole career.",
            "“I love the fact that … we got these crazy political climates, you know, and having care and compassion and caring about kids has no political party,” he said. “Politically, me and Ms. Summer [King] are probably the most diverse people that you could ever find, but we work together so well because the focus is these kids.”",
            "Evan’s time at STEP had a profound effect on him. He said he owes his growth to the program.",
            "“I can’t even tell you where I’d be right now, I’d probably be with a lot of my friends to be honest and they’re not really in good places,” Evan said. “I feel like if it wasn’t for STEP, some of the choices and decisions that I decided not to make, I woulda’ made.”",
            "He said educators at STEP saw him, and students like him, as more than just their mistakes.",
            "“I feel like they all understood us on different levels when other people couldn’t,” Evan said. “I feel like they seen through our anger and our moods and feelings and worked with us until we were feeling better and didn’t let our anger or whatever, like, make them just walk out on us.”",

            "with you and reveal our new district logo. I look forward to seeing how it will be used and seen, and at the same time, we invite you to be a brand ambassador with us and for our new logo. This new mark represents our incredible history and all the good things to come.",
            "After 22 years with the same mark, any organization’s logo can become modified without having dedicated brand guidelines. We recognized it as an opportunity to rebrand and publish new guidelines for us. It is such an honor to have listened to what our stakeholders believe and expect of us, and now present our new logo during this time in MPS’s history.",
            "After conducting research across our district audiences and stakeholders, several descriptive words are either used or that come to mind when discussing MPS such as growth, strength, resilience, safety, and family. As one of the largest public school districts in Oklahoma, it is a point of pride to know that our district is engaged and feels like a part of our MPS family. Most importantly, you trust the work that we do.",
            "I’m thrilled to present our",
            "MPS Brand Guidelines",
            "and invite you to help us secure and protect the visual image and consistency of our new district logo. Thank you for advocating for Moore Public Schools and being a part of our history and journey.",

            "WHY A NEW LOGO",
            "The MPS logo of the \"growing student” was implemented in 2001 and has served our district well. Over the past 22 years, MPS has grown and advanced in all aspects of technology and academic innovation for the benefit of our students, and so now is an appropriate time to update our organization’s brand and logo.",
            "Our new logo is an updated and enhanced version of the 2001 mark for several important reasons. This new mark honors our long and rich history and encourages a look forward to the possibilities for all those who are a part of our present and our future. The new MPS logo is as distinct as our district and reflects the hopeful spirit and energy for learning and growing that represent our students and our employees.",
            "MPS is a diverse community of Pre-K through 12",
            "th",
            "-grade students. Our students, their families, and our employees are comprised of countless backgrounds and cultures, and we likewise provide just as many pathways for learning. The new MPS logo represents our whole family, past, present, and future.",
            "LOGO RESEARCH",
            "MPS Administration conducted a survey of its internal and external stakeholders in the winter of 2023. Survey recipients were of varied generations and cultures and are people involved with MPS in numerous ways. We asked employees at all levels of the organization and from every division to tell us what they think. We asked community and business partners for their opinions and input. We invited students, parents, and guardians to tell us how they feel about MPS.",
            "When analyzing the survey data, there were some clear points of reference. Our stakeholders appreciate and enjoy being a part of MPS in the specific capacity in which they are connected. Our stakeholders also hold a significant sense of pride in our history, and they value the academic progress our students have accomplished over the decades.",
            "When redesigning the new logo, our stakeholders’ input was continually referenced; it is what matters to our students, to our employees, and to our community.",

            "KNOWLEDGE, STRENGTH & SAFETY",
            "An obvious representation of education is a book. Depending on your perspective, the new MPS mark has lines indicating the shape of a book, with a student behind the pages reading. This same shape affirms an aspect of safety when within our schools; an item our stakeholders continually said that we do well. These lines also signal the shape of an “M” as a reference to our district’s name.",
            "PILLARS OF SUPPORT",
            "Our stakeholders confirmed that one of our strengths lies in the abundant programs and resources that support each student’s educational journey. From academics to mental health, MPS is committed to providing pillars of support that enrich each student’s personal and scholastic experience while they are with us. These “pillars” represent every educator, support staff member, academic program, coach, resource, and system in place to assist MPS students as they strive to reach their highest potential.",
            "LEARNING & GROWTH",
            "We concentrate on the foundational learning, growth, and development of each student as they strive to grow into responsible citizens and leaders. We know that what we nurture will flourish, so we are careful to sow seeds of care, respect, and guidance that sprout into a love of learning among our student body. These lines also represent the pathways into college and careers that our graduates take once they leave MPS.",
            "OUR VISION - Our Students",

            "The use of independent, decentralized identities, including variations of the district’s logo, creates confusion in the minds of audiences whose support we seek: students, parents, alumni, community partners, and public school advocates. While logos and symbols are not the sole elements of an institutional brand, they are visual representations and an extension of an organization’s identity. Thus, it becomes essential to handle the MPS logo carefully and provide guidelines for use that everyone can follow, whether it is utilized internally or externally. Through consistent use and a clear understanding of these guidelines, all MPS schools, community members, and employees can build on our unified story.",

            "Frequently Asked Questions",
            "How was the need for the bond election determined?",
            "The Patrons Advisory Committee (PAC) - a group of residents, business leaders, parents/guardians, members of the Board of Education, and school staff - has been evaluating where our district is now and what our district’s future needs will be. As one of the largest districts in the state that continues to experience community growth, we are diligent in maintaining the balance of class size and availability of classrooms. With ever-changing technology advancements and increase of learning options, we must ensure our students have adequate tools and resources for their education. We want our students to have top of the line facilities where they may truly excel. MPS provides a comprehensive STEM/STEAM program for K-12 students. College & Career Readiness Centers would help create pathways for our students from high school to either college or their future careers. The components of this bond issue will propel student success regardless of our district’s and community’s population growth and learning options.",
            "When is the bond election, and where do I vote?",
            "The bond election date is Tuesday, May 11, 2021. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Voting will be in precincts where all other elections are held. All registered voters living in the Moore Public Schools district attendance boundaries are eligible to vote.",
            "How much is the bond issue, and will approval raise my taxes?",
            "This is a multi-phased bond with reoccurring funds to be issued throughout an eight-year period. A tax increase based on historical average is not expected over the life of the bond. This has been determined based on anticipated community growth of 3%, with this past year’s community growth of almost 7%. Two propositions will be on the ballot. Proposition 1: Construction, Renovation, Repair, Replacement Projects with a projected cost of $338,700,000. Proposition 2: Transportation with a projected cost of $8,000,000.",
            "How will this bond election benefit my child?",
            "Every student, in every grade level, and in every school will benefit from this bond. Our schools have different needs due to when they were originally constructed, student population, etc. If the bond passes, the following needs will be met: additional classroom space, heat and air conditioning in facilities and gyms, enclosed practice facilities, roofs, media center(s), safety and security entrances, enclosed campuses, etc. ALL SCHOOLS will receive adequate, much-needed technology and safety/security upgrades to support the educational needs of students well into the future.",
            "How do we know the bond funds are spent the way they are supposed to be?",
            "Our district has a proven and trusted history of completing bond projects as promised. Of the bond projects since 1999, one hundred percent were completed on time and within budget. We are responsible stewards of our taxpayers’ money and will continue this commitment to our community.",
            "What percentage of voters must support a bond election?",
            "The State of Oklahoma requires a super majority of votes cast. Therefore, at least 60% of those votes must be in favor of the bond election for approval.",
            "Can bond money be used for staff salaries?",
            "No. The law only allows bond money to be used for capital improvements and certain instructional materials. This money cannot be spent on salaries, benefits, supplies, or any other general fund expenses.",
            "Can I still vote if I am going to be out of town on election day, May 11, 2021?",
            "Yes. Applications for absentee ballots are available at the Cleveland County and Oklahoma County Election Board offices and available online at: www.ok.gov/elections. The application to receive an absentee ballot must arrive at your county election board office before 5 p.m. on May 5. The completed ballots must be returned to your county election board office by mail no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election. (Postmark will not suffice; the ballots themselves must be at the county election board office by 7 p.m. on election day). Voters may cast an absentee ballot in person at their county’s election board office by 5 p.m. on or before Monday, May 10.",
            "What happens if the bond election does not pass?",
            "Bond money is critical for construction projects necessary to accommodate student growth and ever-evolving learning needs. It is also necessary to provide maintenance and major repairs to schools and facilities. Without these bond funds, monies from other annual district funding sources would be decreased to accomplish the projects included in the proposed bond issue.",

            "Expand All",
            "How was the need for the bond election determined?",
            "The Patrons Advisory Committee (PAC) - a group of residents, business leaders, parents/guardians, members of the Board of Education, and school staff - has been evaluating where our district is now and what our district’s future needs will be. As one of the largest districts in the state that continues to experience community growth, we are diligent in maintaining the balance of class size and availability of classrooms. With ever-changing technology advancements and increase of learning options, we must ensure our students have adequate tools and resources for their education. We want our students to have top of the line facilities where they may truly excel. MPS provides a comprehensive STEM/STEAM program for K-12 students. College & Career Readiness Centers would help create pathways for our students from high school to either college or their future careers. The components of this bond issue will propel student success regardless of our district’s and community’s population growth and learning options.",
            "When is the bond election, and where do I vote?",
            "The bond election date is Tuesday, May 11, 2021. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Voting will be in precincts where all other elections are held. All registered voters living in the Moore Public Schools district attendance boundaries are eligible to vote.",
            "How much is the bond issue, and will approval raise my taxes?",
            "This is a multi-phased bond with reoccurring funds to be issued throughout an eight-year period. A tax increase based on historical average is not expected over the life of the bond. This has been determined based on anticipated community growth of 3%, with this past year’s community growth of almost 7%. Two propositions will be on the ballot. Proposition 1: Construction, Renovation, Repair, Replacement Projects with a projected cost of $338,700,000. Proposition 2: Transportation with a projected cost of $8,000,000.",
            "How will this bond election benefit my child?",
            "Every student, in every grade level, and in every school will benefit from this bond. Our schools have different needs due to when they were originally constructed, student population, etc. If the bond passes, the following needs will be met: additional classroom space, heat and air conditioning in facilities and gyms, enclosed practice facilities, roofs, media center(s), safety and security entrances, enclosed campuses, etc. ALL SCHOOLS will receive adequate, much-needed technology and safety/security upgrades to support the educational needs of students well into the future.",
            "How do we know the bond funds are spent the way they are supposed to be?",
            "Our district has a proven and trusted history of completing bond projects as promised. Of the bond projects since 1999, one hundred percent were completed on time and within budget. We are responsible stewards of our taxpayers’ money and will continue this commitment to our community.",
            "What percentage of voters must support a bond election?",
            "The State of Oklahoma requires a super majority of votes cast. Therefore, at least 60% of those votes must be in favor of the bond",
            "election for approval.",
            "Can bond money be used for staff salaries?",
            "No. The law only allows bond money to be used for capital improvements and certain instructional materials. This money cannot",
            "be spent on salaries, benefits, supplies, or any other general fund expenses.",
            "Can I still vote if I am going to be out of town on election day, May 11, 2021?",
            "Yes. Applications for absentee ballots are available at the Cleveland County and Oklahoma County Election Board offices and available online at: www.ok.gov/elections. The application to receive an absentee ballot must arrive at your county election board office before 5 p.m. on May 5. The completed ballots must be returned to your county election board office by mail no later than 7 p.m. on the day of the election.
